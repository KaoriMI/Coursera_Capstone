    "In this project, we will explore **Japanese restaurants** in **New York**. I am originally from Japan and it's been 5 years since I left my country. And, I enjoy trying out a Japanese restaurant when I travel. This report is targeted for people like me, who want to have Japanese food during the trip especially to a big city, New york. The reason of this feeling could be because you are not completely happy with the quality of your Japanese restaurants in your city or simply you want to try a new restaurant as the number of the Japanese restaurants in your city is limited.\n",

    "When people look for a restaurant, people mostly check the price, rating and location. Therefore, we will explore a Japanese restaurant in New York based on these criteria."
